# GenAI Cookbook

Generative Artificial Intelligence (GenAI) is rapidly transforming various domains by introducing unprecedented levels of novelty, creativity, and productivity, "creating the largest technological shift in our lifetimes." With its ability to respond to human-like natural language instructions, GenAI adds a new interactive dimension to AI applications. It generates new content‚Äîtext, audio, images, and video‚Äîfrom existing data, achieving feats previously unimaginable. Also, GenAI excels in productivity, outperforming humans in some tasks in speed and efficiency.

Welcome to the GenAI cookbook, a blend of how-to recipes and guides for using LLMs. This collection covers a wide range of natural language processing (NLP) applications using language models:

**LLM Prompting Strategies**: Get-started examples to prompting techniques 
**DSPy Framework**: Explore alternatives to prompt engineering with declarative and programmatic approaches to programming LLMs
**Simple Chatbots**: Learn the basics of building interactive AI
**Retrieval Generation Augmentation (RAGs)**: Incorporate personal or organizational data for more accurate responses
**Fine-Tuning LLMs**: Customize models for domain-specific tasks for form, format, and tonality
**Extending LLM Functionality**:  Use agents and functions to enhance capabilities by interacting with external tools and data sources
**Employing Leading Language Models**: Practical guides for using models and inference platforms from OpenAI, Anthropic, Gemini, Meta, Anyscale Endpoints, OLlama, and Databricks.

Aimed at beginner developers, this book provides example code and how-to guides, showcasing how to use APIs and frameworks from leading platforms. Start your journey and discover the potential of GenAI.

To try these examples, you'll need an [OpenAI](https://platform.openai.com/docs/introduction) account and an associated API key, [Anthropic](https://docs.anthropic.com/claude/docs/intro-to-claude), [Pinecone](https://www.pinecone.io/pricing/), [Datrabricks Data Intelligent Platform](https://www.databricks.com/product/data-intelligence-platform) or an [Anyscale Endpoint](https://www.anyscale.com/get-started) account and an associated key. Even better, install [OLlama](https://ollama.com/) on your laptop. 

All examples and notebooks are in Python, yet the concepts can be adapted to any programming language, so long as you can make REST API calls in the target language or use target language's SDK.

## Environment files
Since I use either OpenAI, Anthropic, Google Gemmini, or Anyscale Endpoints, I provide respective environment template files: *env_anyscale_template*, *env_anthropic_template*, *env_google_template*, and *env_openai_template*. 

Add your keys and model name to either of the files and copy the file to **.env** to the top-level directory. To migrate any OpenAI code to Anyscale Endpoints, use this [simple guide](https://docs.endpoints.anyscale.com/guides/migrate-from-openai/). For the most part, the migration is seamless.

Also, you'll require some Python libraries. Use `pip install -r requirements.txt` to install them.

**Note**: Don't share your environment files with API keys publicly.

## Contributing
I welcome contributions. Let's make this a Generative AI developer community-driven resource. Your contributions can include additions or expansions of these how-to guides.

Check existing [issues](https://github.com/dmatrix/genai-cookbook/issues) and [pull requests](https://github.com/dmatrix/genai-cookbook/pulls) before contributing to avoid duplication. If you have suggestions for examples or guides, share them on the issues page.


Have GenAI fun! ü•≥Ô∏è
