Welcome to a mixture of Gen AI cookbook **how-to** recipes for Gen AI applications. These simple guides span across get-started examples on LLM prompting strategies, DSPy, building simple chatbots, retrieval generation augmentation (RAGs), LLM-based applications on OpenAI, Anthropic, Gemini, or Anyscale Endpoints, etc. 

Aimed to develpers who are begining their journey on LLMs, you'll find examples code and/or guides for common tasks using the OpenAI API, Anthropic, Google Gemini, Pinecone, Anyscale Endpoints and [Ray framework](https://www.ray.io/). 

To try these examples, you'll need an [OpenAI](https://platform.openai.com/docs/introduction) account and an associated API key, [Anthropic](https://docs.anthropic.com/claude/docs/intro-to-claude), [Pinecone](https://www.pinecone.io/pricing/), or an [Anyscale Endpoint](https://www.anyscale.com/get-started) account and an associated key. Even better, install [OLlama](https://ollama.com/) on your laptop. 

All examples are in Python, yet the concepts can be adapted to any programming language, so long as you can make REST API calls in the target language or use target language's SDK.

The examples in this cook are inspired (some modified, expanded or copied) from these resources, including:

## Environment files
Since I use either OpenAI, Anthropic, or Anyscale Endpoints, I provide three environment template files: *env_anyscale_template*, *env_anthropic_template*, and *env_openai_template*. Add your keys and model name to either of the files and copy the file to **.env** to the top-level directory. To migrate any OpenAI code to Anyscale Endpoints, use this [simple guide](https://docs.endpoints.anyscale.com/guides/migrate-from-openai/). For the most part, the migration is seamless.

Also, you'll require some Python libraries. Use `pip install -r requirements.txt` to install them.

**Note**: Don't share your environment files with API keys publicly.

## Contributing
I welcome contributions. Let's make this a Generative AI developer community-driven resource. Your contributions can include additions or expansions of these how-to guides.

Check existing [issues](https://github.com/dmatrix/genai-cookbook/issues) and [pull requests](https://github.com/dmatrix/genai-cookbook/pulls) before contributing to avoid duplication. If you have suggestions for examples or guides, share them on the issues page.


Have GenAI fun! ü•≥Ô∏è
