    "Program of thought prompting, like chain of thought, for LLMs involves providing a sequence of reasoning steps in the prompt to guide the model toward a solution. This technique helps the model to process complex problems by breaking them down into intermediate steps, much like a human would. By mimicking human-like reasoning, chain of thought prompting improves the model's ability to handle tasks that require logic, deduction and programming. \n",

      "Reasoning: Let's think step by step in order to find three smallest prime numbers greater than 30,000 using Python. First, we need to understand that the Sieve of Eratosthenes algorithm generates all prime numbers up to a given limit. However, in this case, we only want the first three prime numbers that are greater than 30,000. To achieve this, we can modify the code as follows: 1. Generate all primes using the Sieve of Eratosthenes algorithm up to a limit that is greater than the desired prime numbers. 2. Filter the list to keep only the prime numbers greater than 30,000. 3. Take the first three elements from the filtered list. Here's the corrected code: ```python def sieve_of_eratosthenes(limit): primes = [True] * (limit + 1) p = 2 while True: if not primes[p]: p += 1 continue if p > limit: break for i in range(p*p, limit+1, p): primes[i] = False yield p prime_numbers = list(sieve_of_eratosthenes(60005)) three_smallest_primes = [p for p in prime_numbers if p > 30000][:3] print(three_smallest_primes) ``` This code should work without any errors. It generates all prime numbers up to 60,005 (a limit greater than the desired prime numbers), filters the list to keep only the prime numbers greater than 30,000, and finally takes the first three elements from the filtered list.\n",
