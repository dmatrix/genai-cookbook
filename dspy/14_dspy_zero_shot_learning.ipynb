    "Zero-prompt learning is a challenging yet fascinating area where models are trained to perform tasks without explicit learning examples in the input prompt. Here are some notable examples:\n",
    "\n",
    "GPT-3 and Llama Language Model:\n",
    "\n",
    "GPT-3, Llama 2, Gemini, OLlama, and Claude are powerful language models. The have demonstrated zero-shot learning. That is, without specific learning prompts or examples, it can generate coherent and contextually relevant responses, showcasing its ability to understand and respond to diverse queries.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Named Entity Recognition (NER):\n",
    "\n",
    "Models trained with zero-prompt learning for NER can identify and categorize named entities in text without being explicitly provided with examples for each specific entity.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Dialogue Generation:\n",
    "\n",
    "Zero-shot dialogue generation models can engage in conversations and respond appropriately to user input without being given explicit dialogues as training examples.\n",
    "\n",
    "In our prompt engineering notebooks, we saw examples of zero-shot prompting: Text generation, summarization, translation, etc. None of the prompts were given any language examples to learn from; they model has prior learned knowledge of the language. \n",
    "\n",
    "Let's demonstrate how you can do NER and Dialogue generation with zero-shot learning.\n",
    "\n",
