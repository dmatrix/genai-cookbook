    "## ReAct Technique\n",
    "First introduced in a paper by [Yao et al., 2022](https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.03629), ReAct is a reasoning and acting paradigm that guides LLM to respond in a structured manager to complex queries. Reasoning and actions are interleaved and progressive, in the manner of chain of thought, so that LLM progresses from one result to another, using the previous answer.\n",

    "<img src=\"https://www.promptingguide.ai/_next/image?url=%2F_next%2Fstatic%2Fmedia%2Freact.8e7c93ae.png&w=1920&q=75\">\n",
    "\n",
    "Results suggest that ReAct outperforms other leading methods in language and decision-making tasks, enhancing human understanding and trusting in large language models (LLMs). It is best when combined with chain-of-thought (CoT) steps as individual tasks with results being used for the next step, utilizing both internal knowledge and external information during reasoning.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's first use a few-shot examples to indicate how an LLM should progress with its reasoning and acting to solve a complex query, requiring intermideiate results to progress to its final outcome\n",

Given this information, it would take approximately six days to reach the summit.] I'm not sure but my prediction is [Mount Kilimanjaro's elevation is approximately 19,341 feet (5,895 meters). It is recommended to ascend no more than 3,000 feet per day. Therefore, it would take about six days to reach the summit.]»\n",

      "Accurate Reasoning: Thank you everyone. Let's now holistically evaluate each attempt. Student Attempt #1: The student correctly states that Mount Kilimanjaro has an elevation of approximately 19,341 feet (5,895 meters) and provides a prediction for the number of days it would take to reach the summit based on a daily ascent of no more than 3,000 feet. However, the student does not mention the need for acclimatization days, which are essential when climbing at high altitudes. Student Attempt #2: The student's prediction is consistent with the given information about Mount Kilimanjaro's elevation and the recommended daily ascent rate. However, there's no mention of acclimatization days or their importance in the mountaineering context. Student Attempt #3: This student's attempt is similar to the previous ones. They correctly state Mount Kilimanjaro's elevation and provide a prediction for the number of days it would take to reach the summit while considering daily ascent rates and acclimatization days. However, they don't specify that their prediction includes acclimatization days, which could lead to confusion. Student Attempt #4: This student provides an accurate and detailed answer. They state Mount Kilimanjaro's elevation, recommend a daily ascent rate, and explain the importance of acclimatization days in the context of mountaineering. Their prediction includes both climbing and acclimatization days, making it more comprehensive than others. Student Attempt #5: This student's attempt is almost identical to the correct answer. They correctly state Mount Kilimanjaro's elevation, recommend a daily ascent rate, and provide an accurate prediction for the number of days it would take to reach the summit while accounting for acclimatization days. Ranking: 1. Student Attempt #4; 2. Student Attempt #5; 3. Student Attempt #1 (tie) and Student Attempt #3; Explanation: The correct answer should take into account all the given factors, such as daily ascent rates and acclimatization days. Therefore, Student Attempts #4 and #5 are ranked higher since they provide a more comprehensive answer that accounts for both factors. Student Attempt #1 is ranked third because it does not mention acclimatization days, which is an essential aspect of mountaineering. Finally, Student Attempt #2 is not ranked as it does not provide a prediction or an accurate reasoning based on the given information.\n",
      "\n",
      "Answer:\u001b[32m The correct answer would be similar to Student Attempts #4 and #5, taking into account both daily ascent rates and acclimatization days when predicting the number of days it would take to reach the summit of Mount Kilimanjaro. For example, a common itinerary for climbing Mount Kilimanjaro includes 2-3 days for acclimatization and 4-5 days for summit ascents, making the total time around 6-7 days. However, individual climbing plans may vary depending on factors such as fitness level, experience, and personal preferences.\u001b[0m\n",
