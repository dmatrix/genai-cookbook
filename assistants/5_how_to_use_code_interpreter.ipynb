    "# OpenAI Assistants APIs\n",
    "\n",
    "The Assistants' API lets you create AI assistants in your applications. These assistants follow instructions and use models, tools, and knowledge to answer user questions. In this notebook we are going to use one of the tools, retriever,\n",
    "to query against two pdf documents we will upload.\n",
    "\n",
    "The architeture and data flow diagram below depicts the interaction among all components that comprise OpenAI Assistant APIs. Central to understand is the Threads and Runtime that executes anyschronously, adding and reading messages to the Threads.\n",
    "\n",
    "For integrating the Assistants API:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Creat an Assistant with custom instructions and select a model. Optionally, enable tools like Code Interpreter, Retrieval, and Function Calling.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Initiate a Thread for each user conversation.\n",
    "    \n",
    "3. Add user queries as Messages to the Thread.\n",
    "\n",
    "4.  Run the Assistant on the Thread for responses, which automatically utilizes the enabled tools\n",
    "\n",
    "Below we follow those steps to demonstrate how to integrate Assistants API, using function tool, to ask our Assistant to interact with an external web services, such\n",
    "as Google Search, Weather Stacks, and OpenAI too.\n",
    "\n",
    "This external service could be any external [API Webserivce](https://apilayer.com/)\n",

    "## How to use Assistant API using Tools: Python code interpreter\n",
    "In this example, we will use Python Code interpreter. That is,\n",
    "our Assistant will be asked to analyse an uploaded file, generate an image,\n",
    "and a python script. We can ask Assistant questions about the data file loaded, and it will generate a Python script to run it.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is an example of how an Assistant can employ an external tool, such as a Python code interpreter.  Our query could be part of a larger application using LLM and Assitant to respond to user queries to generate Python scripts \n",
    "that can be used downstream.\n",
    "\n",
