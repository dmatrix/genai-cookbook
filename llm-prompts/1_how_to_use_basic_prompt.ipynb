    "## Basic Prompting\n",
    "\n",
    "Prompts are the basic way to interact and interface with an LLM. Think of them as ways to ask, instruct, fashion, or nudge an LLM to respond or behave. According to Elvis Saravia's [prompt engineering guide](https://www.promptingguide.ai/introduction/elements), a prompt can contain many elements:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Instruction**: describe a specific task you want a model to perform\n",
    "\n",
    "**Context**: additional information or context that can guide's a model's response\n",
    "\n",
    "**Input Data**: expressed as input or question for a model to respond to\n",
    "\n",
    "**Output Format**: the type or format of the output, for example, JSON, how many lines or paragraph\n",
    "Prompts are associated with roles, and roles inform an LLM who is interacting with it and what the interactive behvior ought to be. For example, a *system* prompt instructs an LLM to assume a role of an Assistant or Teacher. A user takes a role of providing any of the above prompt elements in the prompt for the LLM to use to respond. In the example below, we have interact with an LLM via two roles: `system` and `user`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Prompt engineering is an art. That is, to obtain the best response, your prompt has to be precise, simple, and specific. The more succinct and precise the better the response. \n",

He was a writer, scientist, inventor, and diplomat, among other pursuits. Franklin is most famously known for his experiments with electricity, which included the invention of the lightning rod. Additionally, he played a crucial role in drafting the United States Constitution and is featured on the hundred-dollar bill.

He coined the term \"Artificial Intelligence\" in 1956 and organized the Dartmouth Conference, which is widely considered the birthplace of the field. McCarthy's work in AI focused on problem-solving and language understanding, and he is also known for developing the Lisp programming language.

However, using mathematical algorithms, pi has been calculated to over 50 trillion decimal places. The most widely used value of pi is approximately 3.14159, which is accurate enough for most practical applications. Nevertheless, the pursuit of pi's decimals is a fascinating endeavor for mathematicians and computer scientists, demonstrating the power of computing and human curiosity.\n",

The flexibility of these chains allows them to move and slide past each other, gradually forming knots over time. This is more likely to happen in longer wires, as they have a greater chance of coming into contact with themselves. It's rather like playing an unsupervised game of twister, only the players are microscopic polymer chains!\n",

      "\u001b[1mAnswer:\u001b[0m There's no single \"best\" value for pi. Here's why:\n",
      "\n",
      "* **Pi is irrational:**  This means its decimal representation goes on forever without repeating.  Any value we calculate is an approximation.\n",
      "* **Accuracy depends on the application:**  For most everyday calculations, a simple approximation like 3.14 or 22/7 is sufficient. But for scientific applications, engineers and mathematicians may need pi calculated to millions or even trillions of digits.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Records for calculating pi:**\n",
      "\n",
      "* **Current record:**  Over 100 trillion digits (held by Emma Haruka Iwao, 2022)\n",
      "* **Why calculate so many digits?**  Mainly for testing computational power and algorithms, not for practical applications.\n",
      "\n",
      "**So, what's \"best\" depends on the situation.** \n",
      "\n",
      "* For everyday use, 3.14 or 22/7 are fine.\n",
      "* For scientific applications, the number of digits needed depends on the required accuracy.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Important Note:** When you need to use pi in a calculation, use the built-in pi constant provided by your calculator or software. This ensures the most accurate representation possible within the software's limitations.\n",

      "\u001b[1mAnswer:\u001b[0m Wires, unattended, don't actually tie into knots on their own. It's a common misconception! Here's why it seems that way:\n",
      "\n",
      "* **Random Movement:** Wires left loose in a confined space will move around due to air currents, vibrations, or even slight temperature changes. This random movement can create twists and tangles that resemble knots.\n",
      "* **Gravity:** If a wire is dangling, gravity can pull it down, creating loops and twists that can get entangled.\n",
      "* **Friction:** Wires rubbing against each other, or against surfaces, can cause them to stick together, leading to tangles.\n",
      "* **Entanglement:** Even if a wire isn't actively knotting, it can easily become entangled with other wires or objects in its vicinity.\n",
      "\n",
      "It's important to note that wires don't have the inherent ability to tie themselves into knots. The knots we see are a result of external forces and environmental factors. \n",

      "* **Good for:**\n",
      "    * **Real-time data processing:**  Spark's in-memory computation and lightning-fast processing speeds make it ideal for real-time applications like fraud detection, recommendation engines, and stream processing.\n",
      "    * **Batch processing:** Spark can handle large-scale batch jobs like ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) and data warehousing efficiently.\n",
      "    * **Machine learning:** Spark includes libraries like MLlib for distributed machine learning algorithms, enabling you to train models on massive datasets.\n",
      "    * **Graph processing:** Spark's GraphX library provides tools for working with graphs, useful for social network analysis and other graph-based problems.\n",
      "\n",
      "**2. Apache Hadoop**\n",
      "\n",
      "* **Good for:**\n",
      "    * **Massive data storage and processing:** Hadoop is designed for handling enormous datasets that wouldn't fit on a single machine.\n",
      "    * **Batch processing:** It excels at processing large batches of data, ideal for tasks like data warehousing, ETL, and log analysis.\n",
      "    * **Scalability:** Hadoop's distributed nature makes it highly scalable, able to handle vast amounts of data and compute resources.\n",
      "    * **Fault tolerance:** The framework is designed to be fault-tolerant, ensuring data integrity even if nodes fail.\n",
      "\n",
      "**3. Apache Flink**\n",
      "\n",
      "* **Good for:**\n",
      "    * **Real-time streaming analytics:** Flink's focus is on processing continuous streams of data, making it well-suited for applications like real-time monitoring, event processing, and anomaly detection.\n",
      "    * **Low latency:** Flink aims to minimize latency in stream processing, ensuring timely insights from data flows.\n",
      "    * **State management:**  It offers robust state management capabilities for handling data in real-time applications, preserving consistency and enabling stateful operations.\n",
      "    * **Windowing:** Flink supports windowing, allowing you to aggregate and analyze data over specific time intervals, essential for stream analysis.\n",

      "* **Spark:** Ideal for a wide range of data processing tasks, particularly those requiring real-time analysis and machine learning.\n",
      "* **Hadoop:** Great for storing and processing massive datasets in a batch fashion.\n",

      "**Explanation:**\n",

      "1. **`list.sort()`:**\n",
      "   - This method modifies the original list in place.\n",
      "   - It sorts the elements in ascending order by default.\n",
      "   - You can use `reverse=True` to sort in descending order.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **`sorted(list)`:**\n",
      "   - This function creates a new sorted list without modifying the original list.\n",
      "   - It also sorts in ascending order by default.\n",
      "   - You can use `reverse=True` to sort in descending order.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Sorting by a specific key:**\n",
      "   - You can provide a `key` argument to specify a function that extracts a value from each element to use for comparison during sorting. This is useful for sorting complex objects or lists of tuples.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Important Notes:**\n",
      "\n",
      "- Both `sort()` and `sorted()` operate on **mutable sequences** (like lists).\n",
      "- `sort()` modifies the original list, while `sorted()` returns a new sorted list.\n",
      "- The default sorting order is ascending.\n",
      "- You can customize the sorting order using the `key` and `reverse` arguments.\n",
