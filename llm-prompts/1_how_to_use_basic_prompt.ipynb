    "## Basic Prompting\n",
    "\n",
    "Prompts are the basic way to interact and interface with an LLM. Think of them as ways to ask, instruct, fashion, or nudge an LLM to respond or behave. According to Elvis Saravia's [prompt engineering guide](https://www.promptingguide.ai/introduction/elements), a prompt can contain many elements:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Instruction**: describe a specific task you want a model to perform\n",
    "\n",
    "**Context**: additional information or context that can guide's a model's response\n",
    "\n",
    "**Input Data**: expressed as input or question for a model to respond to\n",
    "\n",
    "**Output Format**: the type or format of the output, for example, JSON, how many lines or paragraph\n",
    "Prompts are associated with roles, and roles inform an LLM who is interacting with it and what the interactive behvior ought to be. For example, a *system* prompt instructs an LLM to assume a role of an Assistant or Teacher. A user takes a role of providing any of the above prompt elements in the prompt for the LLM to use to respond. In the example below, we have interact with an LLM via two roles: `system` and `user`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Prompt engineering is an art. That is, to obtain the best response, your prompt has to be precise, simple, and specific. The more succinct and precise the better the response. \n",
    "\n",
    "In her prompt [engineering blog](https://towardsdatascience.com/how-i-won-singapores-gpt-4-prompt-engineering-competition-34c195a93d41) that won the Singpore's GPT-4 prompt engineering competition, Sheila Teo offers practial\n",

      "\u001b[1mAnswer:\u001b[0m  Benjamin Franklin was a founding father of the United States, known for his significant contributions in various fields. He was a writer, scientist, inventor, and diplomat, among other pursuits. Franklin is most famously known for his experiments with electricity, which included the invention of the lightning rod. Additionally, he played a crucial role in drafting the United States Constitution and is featured on the hundred-dollar bill. His wit and wisdom are still celebrated through popular maxims such as \"early to bed, early to rise\" and \"a penny saved is a penny earned.\"\n",

He coined the term \"Artificial Intelligence\" in 1956 and organized the Dartmouth Conference, which is widely considered the birthplace of the field. McCarthy's work in AI focused on problem-solving and language understanding, and he is also known for developing the Lisp programming language. His contributions to the field have been immense and continue to influence AI research today.\n",

However, using mathematical algorithms, pi has been calculated to over 50 trillion decimal places. The most widely used value of pi is approximately 3.14159, which is accurate enough for most practical applications. Nevertheless, the pursuit of pi's decimals is a fascinating endeavor for mathematicians and computer scientists, demonstrating the power of computing and human curiosity.\n",

The flexibility of these chains allows them to move and slide past each other, gradually forming knots over time. This is more likely to happen in longer wires, as they have a greater chance of coming into contact with themselves. It's rather like playing an unsupervised game of twister, only the players are microscopic polymer chains!\n",
